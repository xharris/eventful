# Nice features

- [ ] very simple, mini calendar showing busy/free dates. also shown on event page to show when plans are.
- [x] notifications
- [?] attach images to plan

# Revisit Later

- [ ] Carpool plan 'what' username autocomplete? Should the value just store a user id as a string and parse it differently in the UI?
